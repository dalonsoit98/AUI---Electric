  utter_t10:
    - text: "Before we get started, I'll explain to you what an electric circuit is! Do you already have some knowledge about this concept?"
      
  utter_t11:
    - text: "Alright, let's see what I can further teach you."
      
  utter_t110:
    - text: "No problem, let's see what I can teach you!"
      
  utter_t12:
    - text: "This is a model of an atom. Drag and drop the tags into the different parts of the atom. Try to label the particles correctly!"
      
  utter_t13:
    - text: "Good job! The nucleus sits in the center, while the negative electrons are free to move around it. When these electrons move from atom to atom in a certain direction, they create an electric current. Understood?"

  utter_t131:
    - text: "Almost there! Try again."

  utter_t14:
    - text: "The nucleus is fixed in the center of the atom, while the electrons can move freely, even to other atoms! This relocation of electrons between atoms results in the electric current"
      
  utter_t15:
    - text: "The positive (protons) and neutral (neutrons) charges stay in the center, while the negative charges (electrons) are more free to move. Same charges repel each other, different charges attract each other. When these charged particles move into a certain direction, they create an electric current"
      
  utter_t20:
    - text: "The simplest circuit can be created with a battery, wires and a light bulb. Try to make it work!"
      
  utter_t21:
    - text: "Good job! For an electric current, you need to have a complete path for the electrons to flow. This is why you needed to join the cables. Understood?"
      
  utter_t22:
    - text: "You saw that only 3 components are enough to create an electric current. Can you tell me what each component is and what is their function?"
      
  utter_t23:
    - text : "The electrons can only advance if they have an atom to move to. If the cable is not completely connected, they can not move!"
      
  utter_l11:
    - text: "Now that you know some of the basics, would you like to make a first guess on which could be conducting or insulating?"
      
  utter_l12: 
    - text: "You know, there is no way around it. You cannot skip this step, so let's get started."
      
  utter_l13:
    - text: "You can tag the object with the yellow lighting bolt if you think it's conducting and with the black lighting bolt if you think it's insulating."
      
  utter_l14:
    - text: "Drag the conducting or insulating icon to each object in order to continue"
      
  utter_l15:
    - text: "That's it! Tag the rest of the objects in order to continue!"
      
  utter_l21:
    - text: "Now try to use the objects to complete the circuit! Drag and drop them into the gap to see if theres any changes"
