  utter_t11:
    - text: "Excellent! Let's see what I can further teach you."
      
  utter_t110:
    - text: "Don't worry, that's what I am here for! Let's see what I can teach you!"

  utter_t111:
    - text: "Have you ever seen this before?"
      
  utter_t12:
    - text: "Great! Then, as you know, this is a model of an atom. Drag and drop the tags into the different parts of the atom and try to label the particles correctly!"

  utter_t120:
    - text: "This is a model of the atom. It is almost the smallest component that makes up everything. The atom itself has some smaller particles inside. Neutral and positive particles sit in the center (the nucleus). Outside are the negative particles (electrons) that are able to move around more freely."

  utter_t121:
    - text: "Now try to label the particles correctly!"
      
  utter_t13:
    - text: "Good job! The nucleus sits in the center, while the negative electrons are free to move around it. When these electrons move from atom to atom in a certain direction, they create an electric current. Understood?"

  utter_t131:
    - text: "Almost there! Try again."

  utter_t14:
    - text: "The nucleus is fixed in the center of the atom, while the electrons can move freely, even to other atoms! This relocation of electrons between atoms results in the electric current."
      
  utter_t15:
    - text: "The positive (protons) and neutral (neutrons) charges stay in the center, while the negative charges (electrons) are more free to move. Same charges repel each other, different charges attract each other. When these charged particles move into a certain direction, they create an electric current."
      
      
      
  utter_t20:
    - text: "The simplest circuit can be created with a battery, wires and a light bulb. Try to make it work!"
      
  utter_t200:
    - text: "Can't manage to make it work? Try clicking some parts of the circuit, maybe something will change..."
      
  utter_t21:
    - text: "Good job! For an electric current, you need to have a complete path for the electrons to flow. This is why you needed to join the cables. Understood?"
      
  utter_t22:
    - text: "You saw that only 3 components are enough to create an electric current. Do you know what they do?"
      
  utter_t23:
    - text: "The electrons can only advance if they have an atom to move to. If the cable is not completely connected, they can not move!"

  utter_t24:
    - text: "The battery generates the flow of electrons that will power the light bulb. The light bulb emits light thanks to the flow of electrons. The wire directs the flow of electrons from the battery, through the light bulb and back at the other end of the battery!"

  utter_t25:
    - text: "Ok! Do you want to skip the explanation then?"

  utter_t250:
    - text: "Not bad at all!"

  utter_t26:
    - text: "Great!"

  utter_t27:
    - text: "Now, what makes these wires good for conducting? Can we substitute it for something else?"
      
  utter_t28:
    - text: "The main requirement for conductivity is the availability of free electrons, either in the outer layer of the atom, or introduced as charged particles (ions). This depends on the (molecular) structure of each material."

  utter_t29:
    - text: "But let's save the talk for now. It’s time for you to find out about conductivity yourself!"

    - text: "Now that you know some of the basics, would you like to make a first guess on which item could be conducting or insulating?"

  utter_l12:
    - text: "You can tag the object by dragging the yellow lightning bolt if you think it's conducting. The black lightning bolt means it's insulating instead."

  utter_l120:
    - text: "Go on! Drag the conducting and insulating icons into the objects!"

  utter_l121:
    - text: "Can't manage to do it? Drag the conducting and insulating icons into the objects!"

  utter_l13:
    - text: "Great job! You need to tag all of them now, but don't worry. You can change your mind later on. In the next step you'll be able to experiment with the objects."

  utter_l130:
    - text: "Tag all the objects in order to continue."

  utter_l21:
    - text: "Now you can try the objects by dragging and dropping them into the open circuit. After having tested them, you can tag them like you did before. Understood?"

    - text: "Drag the items into the gap and check if the bulb lights up. You can overwrite the conducting/insulating tags by dragging them into the objects."
      
  utter_l23:

  utter_gold2:
    - text: "Gold is a conductor because its electrics are loosely bound and “free” to move around. This is typical for all metals."

  utter_diamond2:
    - text: "Diamond is, just like Graphite, carbon but in a special arrangement. The atoms are strongly bond in all directions, which makes the material also very hard. Because of these strong bonds, there are no free electrons that can conduct electricity. This is why diamond is an insulator."

  utter_cork2:
    - text: "Cork is an insulator because all of its outer electrons are bound, which is the usual case for non-metals. There are no free electrons that can conduct electricity."

  utter_lemon2:
    - text: "The lemon is a non-metal, but the juice (namely the citric acid) inside is a liquid that can conduct electricity (electrolyte). Inside the juice are positive and negative charged particles (ions), which can conduct electricity."

  utter_lego2:
    - text: "Lego is an insulator because all of its outer electrons are bound, which is the usual case for non-metals. There are no free electrons that can conduct electricity."

  utter_pencil2:
    - text: "The graphite inside the pencil is, just like diamond, carbon but in a special arrangement. Even though it’s not a metal, it conducts electricity like one, which makes it a big exception. This is because it’s arranged in planar sheets where not all of the outer electrons are bonded. They are free and have high mobility. Graphite has a very low resistance and high conductivity, which is why it heats up a lot compared to other conductors. A double sharped pencil could start to burn and the graphite could glow up, which is why this is not recommended as an at-home experiment!"

  utter_bottle2:
    - text: "Glass is an insulator because all of its outer electrons are bound, which is the usual case for non-metals. There are no free electrons that can conduct electricity."

  utter_potato2:
    - text: "The potato is a non-metal, but the liquids inside can conduct electricity (electrolytes). Inside this liquids are positive and negative charged particles (ions), which can conduct electricity."

  utter_log2:
    - text: "Dry Wood is an insulator because all of its outer electrons are bound, which is the usual case for non-metals. There are no free electrons that can conduct electricity. However, wet wood would be able to conduct electricity due to the presence of charged particles (ions)."

  utter_rubber2:
    - text: "Rubber is an insulator because all of its outer electrons are bound, which is the usual case for non-metals. There are no free electrons that can conduct electricity."

  utter_euro2:
    - text: "Paper is an insulator because all of its outer electrons are bound, which is the usual case for non-metals. There are no free electrons that can conduct electricity."

  utter_clip2:
    - text: "A paper-clip is a conductor because its electrics are loosely bound and “free” to move around. This is typical for all metals."

  utter_forkplug:
    - text: "Why shouldn’t you put a fork in a socket?"
      
  utter_forkplug2:
    - text: "When you stick something in the socket, you will get an electric shock. The left slot is connected to the neutral wire (green), the right one to the hot wire (red). Electricity flows from hot to neutral. By bridging those two with an object like a fork, you create a short circuit with increased electric current & voltage. Because you are touching this object, you will feel it as an electric shock. The object will most likely start to burn. Never ever do this at home or anywhere else!"

  utter_forkplug3:
    - text: "To help you with memorizing these concepts, I’d like to give you some daily life examples."


  utter_boots:
    - text: "As you saw before, rubber is an excellent insulator. Solid rubber boots can help you avoid being shocked, because it avoids a closed circuit. That's why electricians always wear them."


  utter_faraday:
    - text: "When a thunderstorm is happening, you should ALWAYS go inside immediately! If it's not possible, you should enter your car (if it's not a convertible and you can close the windows). You are safe inside because the car is a Faraday cage. This means that the electricity (electrons) stay outside of the car, because they want to be as far away from each other as possible."
